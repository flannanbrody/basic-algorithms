	/**
	 * Given an array that contains both positive and negative integers, find
	 * the product of the maximum product subarray. Expected Time complexity is
	 * O(n) and only O(1) extra space can be used.
	 * 
	 * Examples:
	 * 
	 * Input: arr[] = {6, -3, -10, 0, 2} 
	 * Output: 180 // The subarray is {6, -3, -10}
	 * 
	 * Input: arr[] = {-1, -3, -10, 0, 60} 
	 * Output: 60 // The subarray is {60}
	 * 
	 * Input: arr[] = {-2, -3, 0, -2, -40} 
	 * Output: 80 // The subarray is {-2,-40} 
	 * 
	 * The following solution assumes that the given input array always has
	 * a positive ouput. The solution works for all cases mentioned above. It
	 * doesn’t work for arrays like {0, 0, -20, 0}, {0, 0, 0}.. etc. The
	 * solution can be easily modified to handle this case. It is similar to
	 * Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray problem. The only thing to note here is,
	 * maximum product can also be obtained by minimum (negative) product ending
	 * with the previous element multiplied by this element. For example, in
	 * array {12, 2, -3, -5, -6, -2}, when we are at element -2, the maximum
	 * product is multiplication of, minimum product ending with -6 and -2.
	 * 
	 * Time Complexity: O(n)
	 * Auxiliary Space: O(1)
