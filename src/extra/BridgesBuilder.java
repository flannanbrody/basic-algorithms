/*
 * Building Bridges. Consider a 2-D map with a horizontal river passing through its center. 
 * There are n cities on the southern bank with x-coordinates a(1) ... a(n) and n cities on the northern bank 
 * with x-coordinates b(1) ... b(n). You want to connect as many north-south pairs of cities as possible 
 * with bridges such that no two bridges cross. When connecting cities, you can only connect city i on the 
 * northern bank to city i on the southern bank.
 * 
 * Solution: This problem looks similar to Longest Common SubSequence problem.
 * or similar to Longest Increasing SubSequence problem.
